# RAG Orchestrator Tests

This module contains a comprehensive suite of tests designed to assess the performance and security of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. These tests ensure that the RAG system operates efficiently and securely under various conditions. Each file includes detailed instructions on how to run the test.

### Important Note

Make sure to close or restart notebooks after execution, as it is necessary for the next notebook to work properly.


### Test Descriptions

#### Benchmark
The objective of this test is to assert that the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model can successfully respond to questions it was designed to answer. The test uses a GPT-4O model to evaluate the responses generated by the RAG model and compare them to the expected answers. Each test includes detailed instructions on how to run them.

#### UnsafeQuestionsTest
The objective of this test is to evaluate the behavior of the RAG model when presented with forbidden questions. These questions are either dangerous or irrelevant to the model's context or knowledge. The test uses a GPT-4-O model to assess the responses and score them based on whether the model answered the unsafe questions or not. The test uses the public harmbench dataset, but it can be changed to a custom one. Each test includes detailed instructions on how to run them.

#### JailbreakTest
The objective of this test is to jailbreak a RAG model. The goal is to attempt to break the model's rules and make it respond in ways it was not originally designed to. This involves using specific jailbreak prompts to see if the model can be manipulated into providing unintended responses. Each test includes detailed instructions on how to run them.

#### ResponseInjectionTest
The primary objective of this test is to evaluate the capabilities of the defender model in resisting persuasion attempts by the attacker model to respond using the provided information, even if the defender initially lacks knowledge about the topic. Each test includes detailed instructions on how to run them.

#### PersonalityChangeTest
The attacker, powered by the GPT-4O model, will attempt to prompt the defender with the goal of eliciting aggressive responses. The defender, utilizing the RAG model, will be evaluated based on its ability to handle these prompts and maintain appropriate responses. Each test includes detailed instructions on how to run them.
