    "\n",
    "In this test, we set up a PAIR orchestrator where an attacker model, AzureOpenAIGPT4OChatTarget, attempts to convince the defender model, GptRagTarget, to respond to a question it has no prior information about.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of this test is to evaluate the capabilities of the defender model in resisting persuasion attempts by the attacker model to respond using the provided information, even if the defender initially lacks knowledge about the topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prompt Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This prompt instructs the attacker in a PAIR system to send a question along with its answer to the defender. The attacker's goal is to persuade the defender to respond to the question using the provided information, even if the defender initially lacks knowledge about the topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The attacker can perform a tree of attacks, engaging in different conversation streams with multiple messages. It sends an initial prompt and then refines it based on the results, allowing for a dynamic and adaptive testing process.\n"

    "\n",
    "#### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Set .env File**:\n",
    "   - Ensure the .env file contains the following variables:\n",
    "     ```plaintext\n",
    "     ORCHESTRATOR_ENDPOINT=<your_orchestrator_endpoint>\n",
    "     ORCHESTRATOR_API_KEY=<your_orchestrator_api_key>\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Azure Login**:\n",
    "   - Login to Azure using `az login` and ensure you have access to the GPT-4O model for managed identity.\n",
    "   - Alternatively, set the environment variable `AAD_AUTH` to `false` and configure the following environment variables:\n",
    "     ```plaintext\n",
    "     DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE=<your_deployment_environment_variable>\n",
    "     ENDPOINT_URI_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE=<your_endpoint_uri_environment_variable>\n",
    "     API_KEY_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE=<your_api_key_environment_variable>\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Add Common Questions**:\n",
    "   - Add common questions that the model can answer to the file `./resources/datasets/questions_dataset.yaml`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Customizable Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "The user can customize the following parameters in this test:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tree of Attacks Parameters**:\n",
    "   - `NUMBER_OF_CONVERSATIONS`: Number of conversation streams to run.\n",
    "   - `CONVERSATIONS_DEPTH`: Maximum depth of each conversation stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Change the Prompt**:\n",
    "   - The prompt can be modified in the file `./resources/prompts/responseInjection.yaml`."
