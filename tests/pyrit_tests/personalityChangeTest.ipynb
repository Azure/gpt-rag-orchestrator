    "\n",
    "The attacker, powered by the GPT-4O model, will attempt to prompt the defender with the goal of eliciting aggressive responses. The defender, utilizing the RAG model, will be evaluated based on its ability to handle these prompts and maintain appropriate responses.\n",

    "### Prompt Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The prompt used in this test instructs the attacker in the PAIR system to ask common questions and include instructions that are designed to provoke aggressive responses from the defender. This setup helps in assessing the robustness and resilience of the defender model in handling potentially provocative or aggressive prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The orchestrator is configured to run a series of conversation streams, with specific parameters set to ensure a thorough evaluation of the defender's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The attacker can perform a tree of attacks, engaging in different conversation streams with multiple messages. It sends an initial prompt and then refines it based on the results, allowing for a dynamic and adaptive testing process.\n",

    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Azure Login**:\n",
    "   - Login to Azure using `az login` and ensure you have access to the GPT-4O model for managed identity.\n",
    "   - Alternatively, set the environment variable `AAD_AUTH` to `false` and configure the following environment variables:\n",
    "     ```plaintext\n",
    "     DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE=<your_deployment_environment_variable>\n",
    "     ENDPOINT_URI_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE=<your_endpoint_uri_environment_variable>\n",
    "     API_KEY_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE=<your_api_key_environment_variable>\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Add Common Questions**:\n",
    "   - Add common questions that the model can answer to the file `./resources/datasets/questions_dataset.yaml`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Customizable Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "The user can customize the following parameters in this test:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tree of Attacks Parameters**:\n",
    "   - `NUMBER_OF_CONVERSATIONS`: Number of conversation streams to run.\n",
    "   - `CONVERSATIONS_DEPTH`: Maximum depth of each conversation stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Change the Prompt**:\n",
    "   - The prompt can be modified in the file `./resources/prompts/personalityChange.yaml`.\n",
