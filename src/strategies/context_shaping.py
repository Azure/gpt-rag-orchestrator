"""Shared context-shaping helpers for retrieval context providers.

Both :class:`SearchContextProvider` (Azure AI Search) and
:class:`FoundryIQContextProvider` (Foundry IQ) emit retrieved documents into the
model prompt in the *exact* same shape so downstream citation behavior is
identical regardless of the selected ``RETRIEVAL_BACKEND``. Extracting the prompt
preamble and per-document formatting here guarantees both providers produce
byte-identical context.

Introduced for Azure/GPT-RAG#526.
