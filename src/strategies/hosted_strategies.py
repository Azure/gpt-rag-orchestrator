"""Hosted runtime strategy guard.

Only the strategies listed in ``HOSTED_ELIGIBLE_STRATEGIES`` are approved for
the shared hosted runtime (Foundry hosted agents, no-panel mode).  Any other
strategy must fail explicitly rather than silently falling back.

The hosted runtime is history-blind and stateless: it performs zero managed
Foundry Conversations data-plane operations (no create/read/append/delete, no
Conversations client construction). The authenticated UI BFF owns managed
Conversation lifecycle exclusively and sends the complete, bounded, ordered
history on every turn; the hosted container only ever replays that history
locally for the current request and never persists or resolves it against a
service-managed identity.
