"""Foundry hosted-agent container protocol 2.0 header contract.

The Foundry hosted-agent platform gateway drops caller headers outside a
fixed allow-list before a request reaches this container -- most importantly,
``Authorization`` never arrives here and can never be read or forwarded by
this codebase. Two platform-injected headers survive the gateway:

- ``x-agent-user-id``: an opaque *global partition key* for the caller, used
  only for container-side state partitioning. It is not an authenticated
  identity assertion, must never be forwarded to Toolbox or any other
  downstream service, and must never be used to authorize document access.
- ``x-agent-foundry-call-id``: an opaque *per-request* call identifier. Per
  the Foundry hosted-agent contract this is the ONLY thing echoed on
  outbound Foundry/Toolbox-bound HTTP calls. Toolbox resolves the signed-in
  user from this call id server-side -- where the real OAuth context lives
  -- and applies native, per-user document trimming.

ADR-0001 (Azure/GPT-RAG) freezes this passthrough as the required hosted
document-security path: a group-filter or manual ``metadata_security_id``
fallback is not a hosted default. When the call id is absent or malformed,
hosted retrieval must fail closed instead of silently falling back to
service identity or a manual filter.

Never log the call id value, nor whether it was present, above debug level.
