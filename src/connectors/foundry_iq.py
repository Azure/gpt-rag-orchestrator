"""Foundry IQ knowledge base retrieval client.

Targets the Azure AI Search *knowledge base* retrieve action (Foundry IQ), the
agentic-retrieval surface that runs query planning and parallel retrieval across
the knowledge sources bound to a knowledge base. The client mirrors the
``aiohttp`` style of :class:`connectors.search.SearchClient`: it acquires a
service bearer token for ``https://search.azure.com/.default`` and, when an OBO
user token is supplied, forwards it in the ``x-ms-query-source-authorization``
header for per-user document-level security (query-time ACL/RBAC enforcement).

Pattern A vs Pattern B is mostly a *server-side* knowledge base configuration
concern: the client always targets the configured knowledge base name. The one
query-time difference is Pattern B security-field trimming. When enabled,
GPT-RAG injects a ``filterAddOn`` OData filter under ``knowledgeSourceParams``.
That filter is deliberately separate from the native OBO header. The OBO header
drives Foundry IQ permission-aware sources such as ADLS Gen2 ACLs, SharePoint,
Purview, OneLake, and Fabric. The Pattern B filter narrows the registered GPT-RAG
Azure AI Search index that carries custom security fields.

Introduced for Azure/GPT-RAG#526. Per-user security on the retrieve action is a
preview capability, so the API version is pinned to a single configurable
constant (see :data:`DEFAULT_FOUNDRY_IQ_API_VERSION`).

        The knowledge base retrieve response carries a ``references`` array;
        each reference exposes a ``sourceData`` object with the configured
        source fields. Field names vary by knowledge source kind and content
        extraction mode:

        - ``azureBlob`` native sources (both ``minimal`` and ``standard``
          content extraction) return ``sourceData.snippet`` and
          ``sourceData.blob_url`` and do not include ``title``.
        - ``searchIndex`` Pattern B sources return whatever the index
          projects (typically ``content``, ``filepath``/``url``, ``title``).
        - ``workIQ`` (Microsoft 365) sources return ``sourceData.attributions``
          and ``sourceData.extracts`` instead of a flat snippet field. See
          :meth:`_normalize_work_iq_reference`.
        - ``fabricOntology`` (Microsoft Fabric) sources return
          ``sourceData.fabricAnswer`` and/or ``sourceData.fabricRawData``
          alongside ``workspaceId`` / ``ontologyId``. See
          :meth:`_normalize_fabric_iq_reference`.
        - ``fabricDataAgent`` (Microsoft Fabric Data Agent) sources return
          ``sourceData.dataAgentAnswer`` and/or ``sourceData.dataAgentRawData``
          alongside ``workspaceId`` / ``dataAgentId``. See
          :meth:`_normalize_fabric_data_agent_reference`.
        - ``remoteSharePoint`` (Microsoft 365 Copilot Retrieval API) sources
          return ``sourceData.webUrl`` and ``sourceData.resourceMetadata``
          with SharePoint properties (Title, LastModifiedTime, ...) plus
          ``extracts`` snippets. See :meth:`_normalize_sharepoint_remote_reference`.
        - ``indexedOneLake`` (Microsoft Fabric OneLake, indexed) sources
          return an azureBlob-shaped projection: a chunk snippet plus a
          OneLake file pointer, optionally annotated with
          ``workspaceId`` / ``lakehouseId``. See
          :meth:`_normalize_onelake_reference`.
        - ``web`` (Grounding with Bing) sources return generic
          ``sourceData.title`` / ``sourceData.url`` / ``sourceData.snippet``
          fields matching the public Bing-style contract. See
          :meth:`_normalize_web_reference`.

        We accept the union with explicit priority so the downstream
        ``{title, link, content}`` contract is identical across backends,
        and so a future small rename does not silently drop references.
        Title falls back to the link's filename when the source does not
        carry one (true for ``azureBlob`` references).
