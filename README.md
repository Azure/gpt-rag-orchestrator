# GPT-RAG Orchestrator

Part of the [GPT-RAG](https://github.com/Azure/gpt-rag) solution.

The **GPT-RAG Orchestrator** service is an agentic orchestration layer built on Azure AI Foundry Agent Service and the Semantic Kernel framework. It enables agent-based RAG workflows by coordinating multiple specialized agents‚Äîeach with a defined role‚Äîto collaboratively generate accurate, context-aware responses for complex user queries.

### How the Orchestrator Works

The orchestrator uses **Azure AI Foundry Agent Service** for single-agent and connected-agent flows, leveraging its managed runtime for agent lifecycle, state management, and tool orchestration. For multi-agent scenarios, it integrates the **Semantic Kernel Agent Framework** to compose and coordinate specialized agents working together on tasks. Custom agent strategies enable developers to add domain-specific logic without modifying the core orchestration code.

Developers can extend the orchestrator by creating a new subclass of `BaseAgentStrategy`, implementing the required `initiate_agent_flow` method (along with any additional helpers), and registering it in `AgentStrategyFactory.get_strategy` under a unique key.

## Documentation

For comprehensive information about GPT-RAG, including architecture details, configuration guides, best practices, troubleshooting resources, deployment guidance, customization options, and advanced usage scenarios, please refer to the [official project documentation](https://azure.github.io/GPT-RAG/).

## Prerequisites

Provision the infrastructure first by following the GPT-RAG repository instructions [GPT-RAG](https://github.com/azure/gpt-rag/tree/feature/vnext-architecture). This ensures all required Azure resources (e.g., Container App, Storage, AI Search) are in place before deploying the web application.

The machine used to customize and or deploy the service should have:

* Azure CLI: [Install Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
* Azure Developer CLI (optional, if using azd): [Install azd](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd)
* Git: [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* Python 3.12: [Download Python 3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3120/)
* Docker CLI: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* VS Code (recommended): [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
</details>

## How to deploy the orchestrator service

Make sure you're logged in to Azure before anything else:

```bash
az login
```

Clone this repository.

### If you used `azd provision`

Just run:

```shell
azd env refresh
azd deploy 
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure you use the **same** subscription, resource group, environment name, and location from `azd provision`.

### If you did **not** use `azd provision`

You need to set the App Configuration endpoint and run the deploy script.

#### Bash (Linux/macOS):

```bash
export APP_CONFIG_ENDPOINT="https://<your-app-config-name>.azconfig.io"
./scripts/deploy.sh
```

#### PowerShell (Windows):

```powershell
$env:APP_CONFIG_ENDPOINT = "https://<your-app-config-name>.azconfig.io"
.\scripts\deploy.ps1
```
