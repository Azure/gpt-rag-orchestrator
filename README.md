# GPT-RAG Orchestrator

Part of the [GPT-RAG](https://github.com/Azure/gpt-rag) solution.

The **GPT-RAG Orchestrator** service is a modular orchestration system built on Azure AI Foundry Agent Service and the Semantic Kernel framework. It enables agent-based RAG workflows by coordinating multiple specialized agents‚Äîeach with a defined role‚Äîto collaboratively generate accurate, context-aware responses for complex user queries.


### How the Orchestrator Works

_This section will be updated soon to include a detailed explanation of the orchestration flow, agent interactions, and underlying logic. For now, please refer to the source code and comments for insights into how the orchestrator coordinates multi-agent RAG workflows._

## Prerequisites

Before deploying the web application, you must provision the infrastructure as described in the [GPT-RAG](https://github.com/azure/gpt-rag/tree/feature/vnext-architecture) repo. This includes creating all necessary Azure resources required to support the application runtime.


## How to deploy the web app

```shell
azd env refresh
azd deploy 
````
> [!IMPORTANT]
> When running `azd env refresh`, make sure to use the **same subscription**, **resource group**, and **environment name** that you used during the infrastructure deployment. This ensures consistency across components.
