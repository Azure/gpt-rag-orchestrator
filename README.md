# GPT-RAG Orchestrator

Part of the [GPT-RAG](https://github.com/Azure/gpt-rag) solution.

The **GPT-RAG Orchestrator** service is an agentic orchestration layer built on Azure AI Foundry Agent Service and the Semantic Kernel framework. It enables agent-based RAG workflows by coordinating multiple specialized agents‚Äîeach with a defined role‚Äîto collaboratively generate accurate, context-aware responses for complex user queries.

### How the Orchestrator Works

The orchestrator uses **Azure AI Foundry Agent Service** for single-agent and connected-agent flows, leveraging its managed runtime for agent lifecycle, state management, and tool orchestration. For multi-agent scenarios, it integrates the **Semantic Kernel Agent Framework** to compose and coordinate specialized agents working together on tasks. Custom agent strategies enable developers to add domain-specific logic without modifying the core orchestration code.

Developers can extend the orchestrator by creating a new subclass of `BaseAgentStrategy`, implementing the required `initiate_agent_flow` method (along with any additional helpers), and registering it in `AgentStrategyFactory.get_strategy` under a unique key.

## Documentation

For comprehensive information about GPT-RAG, including architecture details, configuration guides, best practices, troubleshooting resources, deployment guidance, customization options, and advanced usage scenarios, please refer to the [official project documentation](https://azure.github.io/GPT-RAG/).

## Prerequisites

Before deploying the application, you must provision the infrastructure as described in the [GPT-RAG](https://github.com/azure/gpt-rag) repo. This includes creating all necessary Azure resources required to support the application runtime.

The machine used to customize and or deploy the service should have:

* Azure CLI: [Install Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
* Azure Developer CLI (optional, if using azd): [Install azd](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd)
* Git: [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* Python 3.12: [Download Python 3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3120/)
* Docker CLI: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* VS Code (recommended): [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
</details>

## How to deploy the orchestrator service

Make sure you're logged in to Azure before anything else:

```bash
az login
```

### Deploying the app with azd (recommended)

Initialize the template:
```shell
azd init -t azure/gpt-rag-orchestrator 
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use the **same environment name** with `azd init` as in the infrastructure deployment to keep components consistent.

Update env variables then deploy:
```shell
azd env refresh
azd deploy 
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Run `azd env refresh` with the **same subscription** and **resource group** used in the infrastructure deployment.

Aqui est√° uma vers√£o mais clara, direta e consistente da instru√ß√£o:

### Deploying the app with a shell script

To deploy using a script, first clone the repository, set the App Configuration endpoint, and then run the deployment script.

##### PowerShell (Windows)

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Azure/gpt-rag-orchestrator.git
$env:APP_CONFIG_ENDPOINT = "https://<your-app-config-name>.azconfig.io"
cd gpt-rag-orchestrator
.\scripts\deploy.ps1
```
