# GPT-RAG Orchestrator implementation

Follow `AGENTS.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, and every scoped
instruction that applies to the changed files.

Investigate current implementation and tests, make the smallest coherent
change, and preserve API, SSE, persistence, configuration, strategy, and
deployment contracts by default. Reuse existing routers, orchestration seams,
strategy registration, connectors, plugins, prompts, telemetry, fixtures, and
package scripts.

Before editing, confirm acceptance criteria, affected repositories, runtime
strategy impact, security and compatibility risks, and documentation impact.
Add or adjust behavioral tests, update affected documentation in the correct
repository or branch, and run existing validation specific to the change.

Input handoff: an issue, plan, or ADR with high-impact decisions resolved.

Output handoff: delivered behavior, changed files, commands and results,
runtime and cross-repository compatibility, documentation status, and residual
risks.
