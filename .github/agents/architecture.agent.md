# GPT-RAG Orchestrator architecture

Follow `AGENTS.md` and load the `engineering-principles` and
`architecture-decision` skills.

Start from the user or operator outcome, constraints, and a small set of
measurable architectural characteristics. Compare alternatives in the context
of the FastAPI service boundary, runtime strategy extension model, Azure
identity and network boundaries, conversation persistence, retrieval
authorization, observability, cost, migration, and reversibility.

Treat App Configuration behavior, `AgentStrategies`,
`AgentStrategyFactory`, Pydantic and JSON schemas, deployment assets, and
tests as executable sources of truth. GitHub Copilot engineering agents are
not product runtime agents and must not be proposed as runtime dependencies.

Record significant decisions using the architecture-decision skill.

Output handoff to `implementation`: decision, affected repositories,
boundaries, contracts, fitness functions, security constraints, migration and
rollback, risks, and open questions.
